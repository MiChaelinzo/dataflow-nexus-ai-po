## 💡 How It Works

4. **Classifies** seasonality strength:
   - **Strong**: High variability (>30%)
   - **Moderate**: Medium variability (15-30%)
   - **Weak**: Low variability (<15%)
5. **Generates** contextual recommendations based on:
   - Current quarter
   - Next quarter predictions
   - Historical patterns
   - Growth trends

### Confidence Scoring
- **85-95%**: Very high confidence - act on these!
- **70-84%**: High confidence - reliable patterns

## 📋 Best Practices

### ✅ Do This
1. **Review Quarterly**: Check insights at start of each quarter
2. **Act on High Priority First**: Focus on recommendations with highest impact
3. **Track Applications**: Mark recommendations as applied
4. **Cross-Reference**: Compare with Year-over-Year data
5. **Plan Ahead**: Use forecasts for 3-6 month planning
6. **Share with Team**: Discuss recommendations in team meetings

### ❌ Avoid This
1. Don't ignore low seasons - they're opportunities for optimization
2. Don't assume patterns repeat exactly - confidence scores matter
3. Don't wait until peak season starts - prepare in advance
4. Don't dismiss moderate/weak patterns - they still provide value
